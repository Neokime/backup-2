  "content": "The Justice Department says a photograph containing an image of President Donald Trump that was removed from its Epstein files library has been restored to the online database. The image shows a desk drawer with several photographs, including one that shows Trump, Jeffrey Epstein’s associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and others. It was released late Friday as part of the Justice Department’s dump of documents related to Epstein. The image disappeared from the website Saturday. In a statement posted to X on Sunday, the Justice Department said it was removed while the agency ascertained whether more needed to be redacted to protect victims. The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction."
